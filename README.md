# Calendar-Scheduler



## Description



This project is a calendar scehduler. It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript. HTML was used to build the rows and display 
the information. CSS was helped to add some color, the color helps signifies what time has passed, what time hasn't 
passed and what's the current time. I tried building this and finishing the code to complete the challenge assignment but to also better my understanding of using API's and better my knowledge of jQuery and DayJS. I learned that documentation and understanding of basic JavaScript in order to use the added databases is very important and crucial to better understand and memorize the functions of the new code added from DayJS and jQuery.
